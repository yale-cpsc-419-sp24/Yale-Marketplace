## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a dedicated web/app platform for the Yale community, facilitating a more structured and accessible marketplace than the current channels, like Facebook groups. The platform will allow Yale students and faculty to list items for sale or giveaway, enabling community members to browse, request, and transact seamlessly. Key features include user authentication (leveraging Yale's central authentication system), search functionalities, seller and buyer views, notifications, and a potential bidding mechanism, enhancing the user experience while maintaining a secure, community-focused environment.
